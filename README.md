#### Biggest Win
The functions may not be the cleanest, the logic meanders at times...but I did it ALL myself. I wrote every single line of this code using my own brain. Considering where I was at three weeks ago, to be able to create this entire site from scratch is so exciting. And best of all, I had fun doing it.

#### Biggest Struggle
Lacking confidence and not trusting myself. Parts of this project were daunting, yet as soon as I started and worked through them I was able to cross things off my list. I need to have more trust in myself and not be afraid to start and fail and figure things out in the process.

#### Assignment
Static comprehensive layout provided by the instructors. Provided phases and rubric laid out expected functionality.
